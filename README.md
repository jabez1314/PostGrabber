Post Grabber
============

A very simple utility that detects POST data and generates an equivalent
"curl" command that can be used in shell or Automator scripts, for example.

It's useful as part of setting up automation.

Post Grabber works with its own internal browser, so it can intercept POST
submissions directly. That means it works with HTTPS, unlike the traditional
web sniffer approach.
